# sis-cli: SIS (PeopleSoft) Read-Only Connector

Pull information from sis.cuhk.edu.cn via `connectors/sis-cli/` (a purely read-only CLI data plane) and relay it to the user. Queries answer directly: nothing is written to wiki and no data area is modified.

## Scope

Read: SIS student self-service pages (weekly schedule with day-of-week / per-term grades / course history / enrollment dates / exam schedule / student center)
Write: none — read-only by design. **Enrollment actions (add/drop/swap classes) and any state-changing transaction are deliberately NOT provided**; the user risks academic penalties for misuse, so never attempt them via raw or any other route. The only POST the CLI ever makes is the term-selection "Continue" query on search pages — a pure query action equivalent to clicking Continue in the browser.

## Prerequisites (install / auth)

1. Install (if missing): `cd connectors/sis-cli && python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/pip install -e .` (deps: curl_cffi + beautifulsoup4 only; may reuse the bb-cli venv via PYTHONPATH for smoke runs)
2. Login: `sis-cli login --username <student-id> --no-store` (password via the `SIS_CLI_PASSWORD` env var or interactive prompt; `--no-store` keeps it off disk; session cookie lives in `~/.sis-cli/session.json`). Credentials only ever live under `~/.sis-cli/`.
3. Self-check: `sis-cli status` lists components when authenticated; sessions expire in ~5 minutes — the CLI re-logs in automatically per command, so no manual re-login is normally needed.

## Steps

1. `sis-cli status` to confirm the session/components
2. Pick a command per the need (see Command cheat sheet); `--format text` prints human-readable lines, JSON keeps structured values
3. Relay the results to the user (language: see Language below)

## Command cheat sheet

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| Weekly schedule + day-of-week timetable | `sis-cli schedule --days --format text` |
| My grades for a term | `sis-cli grades [--term 'Term 2']` (default = newest term; term list is reverse-chronological) |
| Full course history | `sis-cli history` |
| Enrollment dates / registration window | `sis-cli appt [--term 'Summer']` |
| Exam schedule | `sis-cli exam` (empty when not yet published) |
| Student center / per-assignment grades | `sis-cli center` / `sis-cli assignments` (text summaries) |
| Any page as HTML (probe before wrapping) | `sis-cli raw <url> --file out.html` |

Component URLs take the form `/psc/csprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/<COMPONENT>?PORTALPARAM_PTCNAV=<NAV>` — both parts are registered in `siscli/config.py`; use `raw` for anything not yet wrapped.

## Status values

Schedule `--days` rows carry `days` (Mo/Tu/We/Th/Fr/Sa/Su combos), `time` (e.g. `10:30AM - 11:50AM`), `location`; supervision sections may have no fixed meeting (empty days/time). Grades rows carry course/units/grading basis (Graded, Pass/Fail, Distinction/Pass/Failure)/grade/grade points; Pass-type grades have empty points. `--term` accepts a substring (e.g. `Term 2`, `Summer`) matched against term labels like `2025-26 Term 2` / `2025-26 Summer Session`.

## Known limits

- `exam` returns empty until the school publishes the term's exam schedule (mechanism verified)
- `assignments` (per-assignment gradebook) usually shows "no information" — use `grades` for per-term grades
- Tuition / Finances and enrollment-cart read views are not registered — explore via `raw` first, then wrap
- PIA upgrades or sign-in page changes will break the chain: re-run with `SIS_CLI_DEBUG=<dir>` to capture evidence
- Page bodies contain the student's real name and personal data: relay in conversation only, never commit CLI output into any repo

## Prohibitions

- Never perform or emulate write transactions (enroll/drop/swap/edit classes, cart submits, personal-data edits); user faces academic penalties for these
- Student ids / passwords never enter the repo; never echo the password; credentials live only in `~/.sis-cli/`
- Do not paste raw component HTML (contains personal data) into the wiki or commit it

## Language

Follow the upper-layer requirements and the conversation context. Keep course names, course codes, component names, file names, and paths verbatim.
