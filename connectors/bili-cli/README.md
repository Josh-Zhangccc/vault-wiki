# bili-cli

Connector for the wiki bilibili domain (web-cookie login state, homegrown lightweight implementation: requests + self-implemented WBI signing, no community-library dependency). Contract: `.meta/plugins/bili/`.

## Discipline

- **Read-mostly + low-risk write whitelist** (2026-10-06 owner decision): whitelist = watch-later add/remove, favorites add/remove, like; all three require a double gate — an explicit user verb (agent layer) + `--yes` (CLI layer); write operations outside the whitelist (coin/comment/share/follow/dm/danmaku) are never provided, and raw does not carry them either
- Credentials are browser cookies (SESSDATA / bili_jct = csrf): stored only on the local machine in `~/.bili-cli/cookies.json` (0600), never in any repo, never on screen, never echoed in full
- Personal data (watch history / favorites / watch-later) is instance data: relayed within the session only, never committed to any repo

## Usage

```
bili-cli login --cookie "SESSDATA=..; bili_jct=..; buvid3=.."   # import by copying from browser DevTools (or --file)
bili-cli me                                    # my info (login self-check)
bili-cli fav [--fid <id>] [--limit N]          # favorites folder list / contents
bili-cli watchlater                            # watch-later list
bili-cli history [--limit N]                   # watch history (recent window)
bili-cli search <q> [--kind video|up] [--limit N]
bili-cli video <bvid>                          # detail: pages/stats/description
bili-cli subtitle <bvid> [--page N] [--ai]     # subtitle text (CC track by default, --ai forces the AI track)
bili-cli summary <bvid>                          # official AI video summary (needs login; if none has_summary=false)
bili-cli up <mid> [--arcs --limit N]           # UP info (+ recent uploads)
# writes (whitelist, double gate):
bili-cli watchlater add|remove <bvid> --yes
bili-cli fav add|remove <bvid> --fid <id> --yes
bili-cli fav move <bvid> --from <id> --to <id> --yes   # cross-folder move (a whitelisted combination)
bili-cli like <bvid> --yes
bili-cli raw <url> [--post]                    # passthrough (probing/reconciliation)
```

Output is always single-line JSON; timestamps are `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` local timezone.

## Implementation notes

- WBI signing: nav hands out the img/sub keys -> rearrange via the 64-entry table, take the first 32 -> add wts to params and sort -> md5 -> `w_rid`; the key is cached in-process
- When buvid3 is absent it is fetched on demand via `/x/frontend/finger/spi` (risk-control baseline)
- Write-operation forms auto-inject csrf (= bili_jct)
- The endpoint table is centralized in `bilicli/config.py` — when bilibili revamps the site, change it there first; uncovered surfaces go through raw

## Known pitfalls (measured feedback)

- Unofficial web API, no stability promise; code -412 = risk control (keep calls serial and restrained)
- Video-watching degradation chain (measured): CC subtitle -> AI subtitle (--ai) -> official summary (summary, **needs login**, -101 measured) -> audio into wiki/tmp/ for local transcription (user-confirmed, discarded after use); in the anonymous state the AI subtitle track is often empty
- search is first page only; deep pagination goes through raw
- Login expired code -101 -> re-export the cookie

## Changelog

- 0.2.0 2026-10-06: video-ingestion batch (user's four-scenario walkthrough) — subtitle --ai (AI track), summary (official AI summary, measured to need login), fav move (cross-folder move); watching degradation chain disclosed
- 0.1.0 2026-10-06: initial setup — seven design decisions converged through user Q&A (feature surface: personal data + queries + tracking; web-cookie auth; three-item low-risk write whitelist; homegrown light implementation; pull-now, cron later; query-and-answer + emergent archives; full connector + domain set)
