# vault-wiki

**A team-maintained agent knowledge-base framework**: vault holds real assets, wiki keeps md proxies and native notes, and the agent reads/writes with zero priors per the SASU-L disclosure order. md plus plain files are the foundation; Obsidian and friends are replaceable viewers.

> Status: prototype frozen — built 2026-09-08 to 09-12, validated by two rounds of real operation and a cold-start disclosure audit; current stage is daily use, fix as used. Converted from personal use to a team project on 2026-10-02; see `log.md` for the timeline. Universalization and matrix testing remain deferred. Docs language switched to English on 2026-10-06 (historical Chinese log entries preserved as-is).

## What it does

Let an AI coding agent run a "personal wiki" for you:

- Drop assets into `vault/`, any format — md, txt, csv, pdf, images. The **map** command registers each as an md proxy page under `wiki/vault/`, with SHA-256, metadata and links
- Insights and decisions from conversations are distilled by the **save** command into native notes under `wiki/notes/`; session backbone pages go to `wiki/sessions/`
- The **query** command reads the hot cache and indexes first, then answers with wikilink-cited results
- Index, tags, hot cache and the run log are all maintained automatically by the derived layer; the **check** command audits library health; the **plugin** command installs/uninstalls structural plugins
- External sources attach as domains: lark and email land as pointers or archive pages; calendar manages the timeline; project manages project containers; bb pulls courseware, assignments and grades via bb-cli; bilibili answers on demand via bili-cli (search/details/favorites/UP tracking; video summaries and reviews archived on explicit request; low-risk write whitelist behind explicit user verbs). Translation happens outside domains; inside the wiki everything interlinks
- The **profile** command maintains a living cognition file about the user: assertions carry evidence, preferences expire; read it before any personalization
- The **teach** command explains per the cognition profile — skim or quiz the known, unpack the unknown; significant Q&A settles into ai notes
- The **quiz** command generates practice from a scope plus optional samples; grading flows back into the cognition profile
- The **track** command reads/writes per-course user.md learning state; teach and quiz usage mounts here

## Core concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---|---|
| wiki | the md world, the inner side of the inner/outer divide: per-domain projections + native notes + derived layer |
| domain | the adapter contract for an information source outside the wiki. vault is the default domain; lark, project, email, bb, bili are domains too |
| vault | the default domain — the real-asset repository; command side append-only, deletion & editing belong to the human |
| SASU-L | the disclosure paradigm: the agent learns only via system prompt, AGENTS.md, Skills, user's words, loop |

## Layout

| Directory | Contents |
|------|------|
| `.meta/` | Prototype core. 35 plugins: the two conceptual roots domain and wiki; domain instance families vault, lark, project, email, bili and the cuhksz school-domain family (base cuhksz; in-domain bb/bb-map/bb-track/bb-teach/bb-quiz, sis, registry) plus in-domain pieces mapping, structure, lark-docs, lark-im, lark-calendar; cross-cutting pieces calendar, cron, notes, sessions, link, tag, trust, index, hot, log, user-profile, todo, language, device, tmp. No layering; injection order = dependency topology + alphabetical; global plugins may declare bridges, and mandatory bridges are kernel-verified for completeness on domain bases. Also 13 command masters, protocol artifacts — registry, actions, experiments — and the mechanical scripts wiki_plugin_kernel, pipeline, wikilib, pure stdlib with zero deps |
| `connectors/` | Connector masters: deployment-side CLI factual interface + skill usage disclosure. `connectors/*/SKILL.md` lands in `.agents/skills/` via kernel deploy; currently bb-cli, sis-cli, mail-cli, bili-cli |
| `wiki/`, `vault/`, `projects/`, `cuhksz/` | Data-area skeletons. Kept as empty seeds: content belongs to deployment instances; live-repo validation goes through test-repo — see [.meta/docs/sandbox.md](.meta/docs/sandbox.md) |
| `.agents/skills/` | Deployment copies of command & connector skills |
| `test-repo/` | Independent test sandbox. Whitelist-tracked: only the `.meta/` and `.agents/` framework mirrors are committed and re-copied on root-side sync; experimental content stays local, never in history; the sandbox does not perceive this project |
| `.meta/docs/` | Human docs: `intro.md` introduction, `mechanics.md` mechanics, `usage.md` usage guide, `quickstart.md` deployment walkthrough, `research-*.md` research files — direct links at the end. Authoritative mechanics live in the kernel reference skill; docs do not mirror mechanics |

## Collaboration

This repository is a team project. Three red lines summarized here; the authoritative source is the "User Requirements" section of `AGENTS.md`:

1. **Commit boundary**: only development artifacts enter git — `.meta/` incl. `docs/`, `connectors/`, root-level charters, the root data-container empty seed `cuhksz/`, and test-repo whitelist mirrors (only `.meta/` and `.agents/`, re-copied on root-side sync). Never committed: real course/grade/submission data; personal privacy; credentials & sessions; sandbox experiment artifacts — everything outside the test-repo whitelist. Uploading any usage traces is forbidden.
2. **Git discipline**: develop on branches; entering master is manager-gated. The owner has delegated the manager role to an agent: red-line review, kernel validation, merge & push, remote branch governance; reserved matters — history rewriting, exemptions, deleting others' work — still require explicit owner instruction. One commit does one thing; message format `module: summary`; self-check the diff before merging; history rewriting forbidden.
3. **Commit flow**: branch off; small commits; self-check — kernel all passes, diff free of non-development content, log append-only; push and open a PR for review; the manager reviews, merges and reports.
4. **Collaboration alignment**: before touching a plugin or connector, read `log.md` for status & next steps; versions advance along the changelog — no skipping or pre-reserving; experiments & tests always land in the sandbox or locally, conclusions via conversation reports or `.meta/docs/`. Members keep the log append-only; over-limit flows with the branch and escalates; consolidation belongs to the owner.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Python 3, pure stdlib, no install needed for the framework itself (connectors carry their own deps); git; an agent environment that reads AGENTS.md and skills, e.g. ZCode; Obsidian optional, viewer only.

Open an agent session at the repository root. AGENTS.md is the constitution, containing the plugin injection region; the thirteen commands trigger by natural language: **map / save / profile / query / check / plugin / lark-map / bb-map / asset-read / kernel reference / teach / quiz / track** — map, save, profile, query, check, plugin, lark-map, bb-map, asset-read, wiki_plugin_kernel, bb-teach, bb-quiz, bb-track; masters live in `.meta/command/`. Put a file into `vault/` and say "map" to the agent — that is the first use.

## Deployment

The framework proper is three things: `.meta/`, `.agents/skills/`, and the AGENTS.md injection region. Deployment is an additive copy: copy the two trees, write the AGENTS shell, create empty directories, converge with the kernel; existing content in the target repo stays untouched. Derived pages self-build on first run — no hand-crafting. Step-by-step walkthrough in [.meta/docs/quickstart.md](.meta/docs/quickstart.md), rehearsed against a clean directory.

## History

2026-08-26 founded as a copy of the personal library's structure; 08-28 repositioned as this project; 09-08 the plugin-plus-command prototype landed directly, validated by real operation then frozen. 09-12 refactor: the conceptual pair wiki & vault established; the original vault plugin renamed mapping; layering abolished; identifiers anglicized. 09-19 the lark family and the calendar time territory established. 09-22 domainization: the domain conceptual root established; vault, lark, project compliant as instances. 09-29 profile became a standalone command; the email domain established; the connector slot established. 10-01 to 10-02 the bb domain suite landed and was validated across four courses; collaboration red lines set; converted to a team project. 10-04 the bb cognition-consumer refactor — bb-teach, bb-quiz, bb-track commands; mechanics docs opened; docs moved to `.meta/docs/`. 10-05 the cuhksz school domain established, bb demoted into the family, sis and registry sub-domains followed. 10-06 the bilibili domain established (query-and-answer + emergence archives, low-risk write whitelist), connector bili-cli first version; the cron time-automation territory established (declaration-as-source, one page per task), lark-calendar/bili/email migrated onto the bridge; bili 0.3 video-archival batch. Docs switched to English. Design-lineage discussions live in the personal library — see AGENTS.md pointers.
