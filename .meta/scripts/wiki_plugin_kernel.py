"""vault-wiki plugin lifecycle mechanical kernel ((un)install / compliance / dependencies / injection / registry / copy sync).

Positioning (see .meta/protocol/actions.md execution principles): deterministic structural
operations go to this script; semantic judgment goes to the LLM. The script touches only
four places: plugin directories in and out, AGENTS.md injection-region marker blocks,
the registry.yaml plugin section, and .agents/skills/ command copies; the protocol /
reserved sections and handwritten regions are never touched.

Usage:
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py ls          # list + dependencies
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py validate    # compliance and dependency check (read-only, exit code 1 on errors)
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py audit       # plugin attached audits (discovery-style execution of each plugin's scripts/check.py)
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py inject      # rebuild AGENTS.md injection region, check inspection blocks and command usage blocks (idempotent)
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py registry    # rebuild the registry.yaml plugin section (idempotent)
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py deploy      # sync command and connector skill deployment copies (idempotent)
  python .meta/scripts/wiki_plugin_kernel.py all         # validate + inject + registry + deploy

The manifest is a minimal YAML subset: top-level `key: value`, `key: []`, block lists
(`  - item`), one-level field dicts (`  name: description`); double-quoted values are
unquoted; inline comments (starting with ` #`) are stripped.

Dependencies and injection order:
- depends declares behavioral or semantic dependencies (a bridging piece depending on the
  concept plugins at both ends is a semantic dependency); validate checks existence and acyclicity
- injection order = dependency topology (dependees injected first) + alphabetical within
  the same batch; no layering concept

Injection tier and budget (issue #12 layer discipline, see protocol/experiments.md):
- optional manifest field inject_tier (full|member, default full) — member exits the AGENTS.md
  injection region; exposure rides on the family root's roster line, the skill catalog, and
  L-layer reads (the manifest inject field stays the full-disclosure home either way)
- validate requires a member to reach a full-tier domain root through depends (family
  membership, else it exits into invisibility)
- the projected plugin blocks carry a byte budget (INJECT_BUDGET): warning while the tier
  migration is pending, blocking after it lands the region under budget

Command-plugin binding (mutual declaration, validate checks consistency):
- command frontmatter adds owner: plugin id (multiple as an [a, b] list) or framework
  (cross-cutting, explicitly ownerless)
- plugin manifest adds the optional field commands: list of command names this plugin drives
- error cases: command missing owner, owner pointing at an uninstalled plugin, framework
  combined with other owners, plugin declaring a nonexistent command, one-sided declaration
  on either side (owner not claimed by commands, or the reverse)

Command injection (the third projection: plugin write-side contract -> command):
- command frontmatter adds optional consumes: list of plugin ids whose write-side contract
  it consumes (pull side, destination declaration); owner-driven commands must fill it in
  and include all owners
- manifest adds optional usage_routes: list of extra command names this plugin's usage
  lands on (source-side routing) — presence-as-registration on the push side: installing
  the plugin lands the projection, no need to edit hub commands; validate checks routing
  targets exist, routing plugins carry usage, and routing duplicating consumes is an error
- the manifest's usage / checks lists are the sole projection source of write-side contracts
  and inspection rules: checks project into the check command in injection order, usage
  projects into each command SKILL.md's cmd-inject marker block — disclosure order: owner
  blocks first (consumes order), routed blocks in the middle (dependency topology plus
  alphabetical), remaining consumes last; to change a contract, change PLUGIN.yaml —
  command bodies keep only the operational flow.
  PLUGIN.md returns to pure documentation (Role / Structure / Invariants / Changelog)

Global pieces and domain pieces (constitution principle 11):
- the optional manifest bridge key (必依|按需): the extension point and attach cardinality
  declared by a global piece; disclosure prose lands in PLUGIN.md's bridge section
- a domain piece = depends chain reaches domain; depending on domain directly makes a domain base
- validate checks: bridges may only be held by global pieces; a must-attach (必依) bridge
  requires every domain base to have the corresponding depends edge (missing edge is an error)

Plugin attached-audit contract (scripts/check.py, optional):
- must define check(ctx), returning an issue list: {"level": "error"|"warning"|"info", "message": str}
- ctx.root = repository root; ctx.pages = [(wiki-relative path, frontmatter dict, body)],
  shared across the single scan
- read-only with zero side effects: repair actions belong to commands/humans, attached
  audits only report; messages in Chinese, no third-party dependencies
